**Articial Intelligence and Machine Learning**

It is quite rare to find a software company that does not make use of AI or ML in some way these days. The explosion in data availability since the 2000s as well as the growing awareness of the astounding power of AI in solving day to day tasks has resulted in every company making use of AI. Naturally, this has created a need for AI skills and expertise.

Learning AI can seem quite intimidating at first, primarily due to how vast the subject is. But the best way to learn is by starting from the basics and learn by doing. Eventually you might come across particluar fields that capture you interest, which you can then explore more deeply. Here I provide some resources that I have found helpful in getting me started on my AI journey.
